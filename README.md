# Heepio | A Chrome Extension to Bypass Paywalls

![Hippo](bighippo.jpg)

**12ft.io is a ~~great~~ site to get past paywalls. Problem is that they charge you money to use their extension. If I have to pay to use a tool in order to bypass a paywall, why wouldn't I just pay for subscription to the site itself? Initially, I wrote this as a Lua script to concatenate 12ft.io before a given URL but that was just as slow as typing it in myself.**

**Anyways, I wrote this Chrome Plugin to up my javascript game and get around their pay-to-play bullshit scheme.**
