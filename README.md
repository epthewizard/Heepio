# Heepio | A Chrome Extension to Bypass Paywalls

![Hippo](static/bighippo.jpg)

**12ft.io is a ~~great~~ site to get past paywalls. Problem is that they charge you money to use their extension. If I have to pay to use a tool in order to bypass a paywall, why wouldn't I just pay for subscription to the site itself?**

**Anyways, I wrote this Chrome Plugin to avoid having to type `12ft.io/` before every url.**
